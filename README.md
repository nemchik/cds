This is a php script I wrote ad a content display system before I started using WordPress. Development of this project started in 2004 for a high school project and continued through 2009 being used in many of the professional contracted websites I coded.

Looking back I'm not fond of the name I gave the project, but this is what it was, so whatever.

I'm posting this mostly for archival purposes and I do not expect to continue any development, but it was a fun project so I wanted to put the code up.
